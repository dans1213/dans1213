:wave: Hello, I am Daniel Son, I am currently a middle school student at Gretchen Whitney High school in California

I have been studying coding for a few years and have specialized in algorithmic programming and working on app development.

In Algorithmic programming, I have studied mostly in Java even though I am able to somewhat use other OO languages. I am in the Silver Division of USACO and working to get into gold.

Currently I am working on other aspects of programming such as app development. I am currently learning and hope to create some projects that can be used in everyday life.
